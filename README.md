# SQLSurceillance


This script is under development and may be converted into a module.
This script has a menu so helps to install monitoring on your SQL server. It checks who is trying to log into the database.
Over time, you will be given the opportunity to choose which way it will contact you. Mail, Eventlog, etc. possibly. more possibilities.

If you have suggestions for what else it should monitor or you have already made some code, please write.
